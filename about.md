# About Ryan Young

## {{ page.description }}

<b>My name is Ryan Young</b>, and I am a web designer and front-end developer at [Visionary Services](http://www.visionary.com) in Des Moines, Iowa. My aim is to create websites with mobile users in mind, focusing on content, site performance, and accesibility.

I started learning about making websites in late 2012 and never stopped, tinkering with side projects along the way. Recently, I’ve been studying up on JavaScript &mdash; my first foray into a true programmming language, which has really expanded my understanding of the web and the capabilities of client-side code.

I listen to a lot of podcasts on a regular basis, either while I’m at the office or at home relaxing. Some of my favorite active ones include:

- [Ctrl+Click Cast](http://ctrlclickcast.com)
- [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com)
- [Developer Tea](http://developertea.com)
- [Let’s Make Mistakes](http://www.muleradio.net/mistakes)
- [DevTips Show](https://www.youtube.com/DevTipsForDesigners)

If you’d like to get in touch, I am always on Twitter. Ping me here: [@rcyou](http://twitter.com/rcyou).


<b>For what it’s worth:</b> I once was profiled in a local Des Moines magazine called _Juice_. [You can read that Q&A here.](http://dmjuice.com/get-to-know-ryan-young-26)
